## Introduction
This repository contains a replica of StackOverflow,
which focuses on gaining practical experience in web development using Node.js. 
The project demonstrates my understanding of web application architecture, server-side programming, and modern JavaScript development practices. 
Through this assignment, I've applied theoretical concepts learned in the course to build a functional web application.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side development
- **Express.js** - Web application framework for Node.js
- **HTML/CSS** - Frontend structure and styling
- **JavaScript** - Client-side and server-side programming
- **npm** - Package management
- **MongoDB** - Database management

## Features
This web application includes the following features:

### User Management
- User registration with email verification
- Secure authentication using JWT tokens
- User profile management
- Role-based access control

### Content Management
- Create, read, update, and delete operations for Questions and Answers
- Media upload and management
- Content categorization and tagging
